<h3 align='center'>👋 Welcome to my Profile!</h3> 

<p align='center'>
I'm <strong>Octavian Pullum</strong>, a current Computer Science student at <a href='https://www.umgc.edu target='_blank'>University of Maryland Global Campus</a> I'm attending classes remotely, and working to improve myself in aspects of self-learning. Additionally, I'm working to become a Full-Stack Developer through online resources and courses like Scrimba. Coding is a creative art, and I want the knowledge to create any idea I can imagine.
</p>

<p align='center'>
Additionally, I'm enrolled in the Machine Learning certificate program at UMGC. This involves study in Statistics, Machine Learning Fundamentals, and general Data Science principles.
I would love to work on projects with others, and I constantly look for opportunities to work with those around me!
