### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Profile!
I'm **Octavian Pullum**, a current Computer Science student at [University of Maryland Global Campus](https://www.umgc.edu) with additional study in Machine Learning! I'm attending classes remotely, and working to improve myself in aspects of self-learning. Additionally, I'm also working on digital courses through platforms like AWS Training, IBM Skillsbuild, Udemy, and Coursera. Currently, my focuses are improving myself in languages so I can develop anything that comes to mind. I firmly believe small improvement everyday accumulate to massive results!

I'm working on Python basics and will shortly be moving onto OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MatPlotLib, and similar libraries. This is due to my current movement towards AI and Machine Learning.
I would love to work on projects with others, and I constantly look for opportunities to work with those around me!
