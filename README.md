### 👋 Welcome to my Profile!
I'm **Octavian Pullum**, a current Computer Science student at [University of Maryland Global Campus](https://www.umgc.edu) with additional study in Machine Learning! I'm attending classes remotely, and working to improve myself in aspects of self-learning. At present, I'm working on becoming a Full-Stack Developer through online resources and courses like Scrimba. Coding is a creative art, and I want the knowledge to create any idea I can imagine.

Additionally, I'm enrolled in the Machine Learning certificate program at UMGC. This involves study in Statistics, Machine Learning Fundamentals, and general Data Science principles.
I would love to work on projects with others, and I constantly look for opportunities to work with those around me!
